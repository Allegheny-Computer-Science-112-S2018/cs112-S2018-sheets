\section*{Objectives}

To learn how to use GitHub to access the files for a laboratory assignment.
Additionally, to review how to use the Ubuntu operating system and software
development programs such as a ``terminal window'' and the ``text editor''. You
will also continue to practice using Slack to support communication with the
teaching assistants and the instructor. Next, you will learn how to implement
and test a Java program that passes parameters to swap values, also practicing
how to use an automated grading tool to assess your progress towards correctly
completing the project.

\section*{Suggestions for Success}

\begin{itemize}
  \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}

\item {\bf Use the laboratory computers}. The computers in this laboratory feature specialized software for completing
  this course's laboratory and practical assignments. If it is necessary for you to work on a different machine, be sure
  to regularly transfer your work to a laboratory machine so that you can check its correctness. If you cannot use a
  laboratory computer and you need help with the configuration of your own laptop, then please carefully explain its
  setup to a teaching assistant or the course instructor when you are asking questions.

\item {\bf Follow each step carefully}. Slowly read each sentence in the assignment sheet, making sure that you
  precisely follow each instruction. Take notes about each step that you attempt, recording your questions and ideas and
  the challenges that you faced. If you are stuck, then please tell a teaching assistant or instructor what assignment
  step you recently completed.

\item {\bf Regularly ask and answer questions}. Please log into Slack at the start of a laboratory or practical session
  and then join the appropriate channel. If you have a question about one of the steps in an assignment, then you can
  post it to the designated channel. Or, you can ask a student sitting next to you or talk with a teaching assistant or
  the course instructor.

\item {\bf Store your files in GitHub}. Starting with this laboratory assignment, you will be responsible for storing
  all of your files (e.g., Java source code and Markdown-based writing) in a Git repository using GitHub Classroom.
  Please verify that you have saved your source code in your Git repository by using \command{git status} to ensure that
  everything is updated. You can see if your assignment submission meets the established correctness requirements by
  using the provided checking tools on your local computer and in checking the commits in GitHub.

\item {\bf Keep all of your files}. Don't delete your programs, output files, and written reports after you submit them
  through GitHub; you will need them again when you study for the quizzes and examinations and work on the other
  laboratory, practical, and final project assignments.

\item {\bf Back up your files regularly}. All of your files are regularly backed-up to the servers in the Department of
  Computer Science and, if you commit your files regularly, stored on GitHub. However, you may want to use a flash
  drive, Google Drive, or your favorite backup method to keep an extra copy of your files on reserve. In the event of
  any type of system failure, you are responsible for ensuring that you have access to a recent backup copy of all your
  files.

\item {\bf Explore teamwork and technologies}. While certain aspects of the laboratory assignments will be challenging
  for you, each part is designed to give you the opportunity to learn both fundamental concepts in the field of computer
  science and explore advanced technologies that are commonly employed at a wide variety of companies. To explore and
  develop new ideas, you should regularly communicate with your team and/or the teaching assistants and tutors.

\item {\bf Hone your technical writing skills}. Computer science assignments require to you write technical
  documentation and descriptions of your experiences when completing each task. Take extra care to ensure that your
  writing is interesting and both grammatically and technically correct, remembering that computer scientists must
  effectively communicate and collaborate with their team members and the tutors, teaching assistants, and course
  instructor.

\item {\bf Review the Honor Code on the syllabus}. While you may discuss your assignments with others, copying source
  code or writing is a violation of Allegheny College's Honor Code.

\end{itemize}

\section*{Reading Assignment}

If you have not done so already, please read all of the relevant ``GitHub Guides'', available at
\url{https://guides.github.com/}, that explain how to use many of the features that GitHub provides. In particular,
please make sure that you have read guides such as ``Mastering Markdown'' and ``Documenting Your Projects on GitHub'';
each of them will help you to understand how to use both GitHub and GitHub Classroom. To do well on this assignment, you
should also read Chapter 1 in the textbook, paying particularly close attention to Code Fragments 1.5, 1.6, and 1.7.
Please see the instructor or one of the teaching assistants if you have questions on this reading assignment.

\section*{Using Your Computer Science Account}

In advance of today's lab you have already received the details about your Alden Hall computer account and learned how
to log on and use programs. You should ensure that you have recorded how to complete these steps in your notebook;
please report any problems as soon as they occur. You may use this account on any computer in Alden labs 101, 103, or
109. Your files are stored on a central server; you don't have to use the same machine every time you log on in a
laboratory.

Hours of lab availability are posted on the bulletin board in each lab and on the following Web site:
\url{http://www.cs.allegheny.edu/}; the on-duty lab monitor is always available in an Alden lab.

\section*{Configuring Git and GitHub}

% You may see the course instructor or one of the teaching assistants if you are not able to complete a certain step or if
% you are not sure how to proceed.

During this laboratory assignment and the subsequent laboratory and practical assignments, we will securely communicate
with the GitHub servers that will host all of the project templates and your submitted deliverables. In this assignment,
you will perform all of the steps to configure your account on GitHub and you will start your first assignment using
GitHub Classroom. Throughout this assignment, you should refer to the following web sites for more information:
\url{https://guides.github.com/} and, in particular, \url{https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/}. You can
also learn more about GitHub Classroom by visiting \url{https://classroom.github.com/}. As you will be required to use
Git, an industry standard tool, in all of the remaining laboratory and practical assignments and during the class
sessions, you should keep a record of all of the steps that you complete and the challenges that you face. Note that you
do not need to complete these steps if you already have an account on GitHub and you will use a laboratory computer to
finish assignments.

\begin{enumerate}

  \itemsep 0in

  \item If you do not already have a GitHub account, then please go to the GitHub web site and create one, making sure
    that you use your \command{allegheny.edu} email address so that you can join GitHub as a student at an accredited
    educational institution. You are also encouraged to sign up for GitHub's ``Student Developer Pack'' at
    \url{https://education.github.com/pack}, qualifying you to receive free software development tools. Additionally,
    please add a description of yourself and an appropriate professional photograph to your GitHub profile. Unless your
    username is taken, you should also pick your GitHub username to be the same as Allegheny's Google-based email
    account. Now, in the \channel{#labs} channel of our Slack team, please type on one line your full name,
    \command{allegheny.edu} email address, and your new GitHub username. If you have already typed this information into
    Slack during a prior class, you do not need to do so again.

  \item If you have never done so before, you must use the \command{ssh-keygen} program to create secure-shell keys that
    you can use to support your communication with GitHub. But, to start, this task requires you to type commands in a
    program that is known as a terminal. To run it, click on the icon, on the left side of your screen, that contains
    the \command{>} symbol. Alternatively, you can type the ``Super'' key, start typing the word ``terminal'', and then
    select that program. Another way to open a terminal involves typing the key combination \command{<Ctrl>-<Alt>-t}.
    Once the Ubuntu terminal starts, it will display as a box into which you can type commands.

  \item Now that you have started the terminal, you will now need to type the \command{ssh-keygen} command in it. Follow
    the prompts to create your keys and save them in the default directory. That is, you should press ``Enter'' after
    you are prompted to \command{Enter file in which to save the key ...  :} and then type your selected passphrase
    whenever you are prompted to do so. Please note that a ``passphrase'' is like a password that you will type when you
    need to prove your identify to GitHub. What files does \command{ssh-keygen} produce? Where does this program store
    these files by default? Do you have any questions about completing this step?

  \item Once you have created your ssh keys, you should raise your hand to invite either a teaching assistant or the
    course instructor to help you with the next steps. First, you must log into GitHub and look in the right corner for
    an account avatar with a down arrow. Click on this link and then select the ``Settings'' option. Now, scroll down
    until you find the ``SSH and GPG keys'' label on the left, click to create a ``New SSH key'', and then upload your
    ssh key to GitHub. You can copy your SSH key to the clipboard by going to the terminal and typing ``{\tt cat
    \textasciitilde{}/.ssh/id\_rsa.pub}'' command and then highlighting this output. When you are completing this step
    in your terminal window, please make sure that you only highlight the letters and numbers in your key---if you
    highlight any extra symbols or spaces then this step may not work correctly. Then, paste this into the GitHub text
    field in your web browser.

  \item Again, when you are completing these steps, please make sure that you take careful notes about the inputs,
    outputs, and behavior of each command. If there is something that you do not understand, then please ask the course
    instructor or the teaching assistant about it.

  \item Since this is your first laboratory assignment and you are still learning how to use the appropriate software,
    don't become frustrated if you make a mistake. Instead, use your mistakes as an opportunity for learning both about
    the necessary technology and the background and expertise of the other students in the class, the teaching
    assistants, and the course instructor. Remember, you can use Slack to talk with the instructor by typing
    \command{@gkapfham} in a channel.

\end{enumerate}

\section*{Accessing the Practical Assignment on GitHub}

To access the laboratory assignment, you should go into the \channel{\#announcements} channel in our Slack team and find
the announcement that provides a link for it. Copy this link and paste it into a web browser. Now, you should accept the
assignment and see that GitHub Classroom created a new GitHub repository for you to access the assignment's starting
materials and to store the completed version of your assignment. Specifically, to access your new GitHub repository for
this assignment, please click the green ``Accept'' button and then click the link that is prefaced with the label ``Your
assignment has been created here''. If you accepted the assignment and correctly followed these steps, you should have
created a GitHub repository with a name like
``Allegheny-Computer-Science-112-Spring-2018/computer-science-112-spring-2018-lab-1-gkapfham''. Unless you provide the
instructor with documentation of the extenuating circumstances that you are facing, not accepting the assignment means
that you automatically receive a failing grade for it.

Before you move to the next step of this assignment, please make sure that you read all of the content on the web site
for your new GitHub repository, paying close attention to the technical details about the commands that you will type
and the output that your program must produce. Now you are ready to download the starting materials to your laboratory
computer. Click the ``Clone or download'' button and, after ensuring that you have selected ``Clone with SSH'', please
copy this command to your clipboard. At this point, you can open a new terminal window and type the command
\command{mkdir cs112S2018}. To enter into this directory you should now type \command{cd cs112S2018}. Next, you can type
the command \command{ls} and see that there are no files or directories inside of this directory. By typing \command{git
clone} in your terminal and then pasting in the string that you copied from the GitHub site you will download all of the
code for this assignment. For instance, if the course instructor ran the \command{git clone} command in the terminal, it
would look like:

\begin{lstlisting}
  git clone https://github.com/Allegheny-Computer-Science-112-S2018/computer-science-112-spring-2018-lab-1-gkapfham.git
\end{lstlisting}

After this command finishes, you can use \command{cd} to change into the new directory. If you want to \step{go back}
one directory from your current location, then you can type the command \command{cd ..}. Please continue to use the
\command{cd} and \command{ls} commands to explore the files that you automatically downloaded from GitHub. What files
and directories do you see? What do you think is their purpose? Spend some time exploring, sharing your discoveries with
a neighbor and a \mbox{teaching assistant}.

\section*{Enhancing and Testing a Java Program}

In order view the source code of a Java program or a Markdown-based writing assignment, you need a text editor. There
are many different text editors on your workstation and you should feel free to explore these on your own. For instance,
you may adopt either the GVim or the Atom text editor to complete this laboratory assignment. Please study the source
code of the \mainprogram, noticing that some of its methods are incomplete. You can refer to the Code Fragments in the
textbook to discover the missing source code and add it back into the program. Next, you should also notice that the
\mainprogram{} has a test suite called \testprogram{} that is written in the JUnit testing framework; please refer to
Section 1.9 and the comment's in the source code of this test suite to learn more about how it works. Intuitively, a
Junit test suite has individual test cases, written as Java methods, that each work to establish a confidence in the
correctness of \mainprogram{}.

Now, if you want to \step{build} your program you can type the command \gradlebuild{} in your terminal, thereby causing
the Java compiler to check your program for errors and get it ready to run. If you get any error messages, go back to
your text editor and figure out what you mis-typed and fix it. Once you have solved the problem, make a note of the
error and the solution for resolving it. Re-save your program and then build it again by re-running the \gradlebuild{}.
If you cannot build \mainprogram{} correctly, then please talk with a teaching assistant or the instructor. You can also
run the test suite for the \mainprogram{} by typing \gradletest{} in the terminal. What is the purpose of each of these
test cases? What output do you see from running the test suite? Does this output suggest that the program is likely to
produce the correct output? How did you know?

Once you resolve all of the building and testing errors, you can run your program by typing \gradlerun{} in the terminal
window---this is the ``execute'' step that will run your program and produce the designated output. You can see if your
program is producing the desired output by looking at Code Fragment 1.7. Do you see that it produces twenty lines of
output? Can you see that it computes the correct numerical values? If not, then repair the program and re-build and
re-run it. Once the program runs, please reflect on this process. What step did you find to be the most challenging?
Why? You should write your reflections in a file, called \reflection{}, that uses the Markdown writing language. You can
learn more about Markdown by viewing the aforementioned GitHub guide. To complete this aspect of the assignment, you
should write one high-quality paragraph that reports on your experiences. Your \reflection{} should also contain answers
to other questions, about \mainprogram{}, posed at the end of this assignment sheet.

Since this is our first laboratory assignment and you are still learning how to use the appropriate hardware and
software, don't become frustrated if you make a mistake. Instead, use your mistakes as an opportunity for learning both
about the necessary technology and the background and expertise of the other students in the class, the teaching
assistants, and the course instructor.

\section*{Checking the Correctness of Your Program and Writing}

As verified by Checkstyle tool, the source code for the \mainprogram{} and \testprogram{} files must adhere to all of
the requirements in the Google Java Style Guide available at \url{https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html}.
The Markdown file that contains your reflection must adhere to the standards described in the Markdown Syntax Guide
\url{https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/}. Finally, your \reflection{} file should adhere to the
Markdown standards established by the \step{Markdown linting} tool available at
\url{https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint/} and the writing standards set by the \step{prose linting} tool from
\url{http://proselint.com/}. Instead of requiring you to manually check that your deliverables adhere to these
industry-accepted standards, GatorGrader makes it easy for you to automatically check if your submission meets the
standards for correctness. For instance, GatorGrader will run the provided JUnit tests, check to ensure that
\mainprogram{} produces exactly twenty lines of output, and see that you commit to GitHub a sufficient number of times
when completing this assignment.

To get started with the use of GatorGrader, type the command \gatorgraderstart{} in your terminal window. Once this step
completes you can type \gatorgradercheck{}. If your work does not meet all of the assignment's requirements, then you
will see the following output in your terminal: \command{Overall, are there any mistakes in the assignment? Yes}. If you
do have mistakes in your assignment, then you will need to review GatorGrader's output, find the mistake, and try to fix
it. Once your program is building correctly, fulfilling at least some of the assignment's requirements, you should
transfer your files to GitHub using the \gitcommit{} and \gitpush{} commands. For example, if you want to signal that
the \mainprogramsource{} file has been changed and is ready for transfer to GitHub you would first type
\gitcommitmainprogram{} in your terminal, followed by typing \gitpush{} and checking to see that the transfer to GitHub
is successful. If you notice that transferring your code or writing to GitHub did not work correctly, then please try to
determine why, asking a teaching assistant or the course instructor for assistance, if necessary.

After the course instructor enables \step{continuous integration} with a system called Travis CI, when you use the
\gitpush{} command to transfer your source code to your GitHub repository, Travis CI will initialize a \step{build} of
your assignment, checking to see if it meets all of the requirements. If both your source code and writing meet all of
the established requirements, then you will see a green \checkmark{} in the listing of commits in GitHub after awhile.
If your submission does not meet the requirements, a red \naughtmark{} will appear instead. The instructor will reduce a
student's grade for this assignment if the red \naughtmark{} appears on the last commit in GitHub immediately before the
assignment's due date. Yet, if the green \checkmark{} appears on the last commit in your GitHub repository, then you
satisfied all of the main checks, thereby allowing the course instructor to evaluate other aspects of your source code
and writing, as further described in the \step{Evaluation} section of this assignment sheet. Unless you provide the
instructor with documentation of the extenuating circumstances that you are facing, no late work will be considered
towards your grade for this laboratory assignment.

Please note that if you are completing this laboratory assignment on your own laptop the GatorGrader program will only
run correctly if you have installed all of the programs on which it depends. You can see these dependencies (i.e.,
Gradle, Java, Markdownlint, Proselint, and Python) by reading the documentation in your GitHub repository for this
assignment. Note that assignment checking will still work with Travis CI even if you do not have these programs
installed on your laptop. Please see the instructor or teaching assistant if you have trouble installing these programs.

\section*{Summary of the Required Deliverables}

\noindent Students do not need to submit printed source code or technical writing for any assignment in this course.
Instead, this assignment invites you to submit, using GitHub, the following deliverables.

\begin{enumerate}

  \setlength{\itemsep}{0in}

\item A properly documented, well-formatted, and correct version of \mainprogramsource{} that both meets all of the
  established requirements and produces the desired output.

\end{enumerate}

\section*{Evaluation of Your Laboratory Assignment}

Using a report that the instructor shares with you through the commit log in GitHub, you will privately received a grade
on this assignment and feedback on your submitted deliverables. Your grade for the assignment will be a function of the
whether or not it was submitted in a timely fashion and if your program received a green \checkmark{} indicating that it
met all of the requirements. Other factors will also influence your final grade on the assignment. In addition to
studying the efficiency and effectiveness of your Java source code, the instructor will also evaluate the accuracy of
both your technical writing and the comments in your source code. If your submission receives a red \naughtmark{}, the
instructor will reduce your grade for the assignment while still considering the regularity with which you committed to
your GitHub repository and the overall quality of your partially completed work. Please see the instructor if you have
questions about the evaluation of this laboratory assignment.

\section*{Adhering to the Honor Code}

In adherence to the Honor Code, students should complete this assignment on an individual basis. While it is appropriate
for students in this class to have high-level conversations about the assignment, it is necessary to distinguish
carefully between the student who discusses the principles underlying a problem with others and the student who produces
assignments that are identical to, or merely variations on, someone else's work. Deliverables (e.g., Java source code or
Markdown-based technical writing) that are nearly identical to the work of others will be taken as evidence of violating
the \mbox{Honor Code}. Please see the course instructor if you have questions about this policy.

\end{document}
