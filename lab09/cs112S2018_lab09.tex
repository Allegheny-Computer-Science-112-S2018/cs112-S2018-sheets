\section*{Objectives}

To continue to practice using GitHub to access the files for an assignment. You
will complete a programming project using source code provided in the textbook
and by the course instructor, ultimately implementing a full-featured and
well-tested implementation of the \program{ArrayList} described in Chapter 7.
Specifically, you will implement and test several methods of an array-based list
data structure and then run a test suite to ensure that operations, like the
\program{set}, \program{toString}, and \program{equals} methods, are working
correctly. In addition to thinking about the worst-case time complexity of
methods, you will continue to practice using JUnit to implement and test a data
structure and using a grading tool to assess your progress towards correctly
completing the entire project.

\section*{Suggestions for Success}

\begin{itemize}
  \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}

\item {\bf Use the laboratory computers}. The computers in this laboratory feature specialized software for completing
  this course's laboratory and practical assignments. If it is necessary for you to work on a different machine, be sure
  to regularly transfer your work to a laboratory machine so that you can check its correctness. If you cannot use a
  laboratory computer and you need help with the configuration of your own laptop, then please carefully explain its
  setup to a teaching assistant or the course instructor when you are asking questions.

\item {\bf Follow each step carefully}. Slowly read each sentence in the assignment sheet, making sure that you
  precisely follow each instruction. Take notes about each step that you attempt, recording your questions and ideas and
  the challenges that you faced. If you are stuck, then please tell a teaching assistant or instructor what assignment
  step you recently completed.

\item {\bf Regularly ask and answer questions}. Please log into Slack at the start of a laboratory or practical session
  and then join the appropriate channel. If you have a question about one of the steps in an assignment, then you can
  post it to the designated channel. Or, you can ask a student sitting next to you or talk with a teaching assistant or
  the course instructor.

\item {\bf Store your files in GitHub}. As in previous laboratory assignments, you will be responsible for storing
  all of your files (e.g., Java source code and Markdown-based writing) in a Git repository using GitHub Classroom.
  Please verify that you have saved your source code in your Git repository by using \command{git status} to ensure that
  everything is updated. You can see if your assignment submission meets the established correctness requirements by
  using the provided checking tools on your local computer and in checking the commits in GitHub.

\item {\bf Keep all of your files}. Don't delete your programs, output files, and written reports after you submit them
  through GitHub; you will need them again when you study for the quizzes and examinations and work on the other
  laboratory, practical, and final project assignments.

\item {\bf Back up your files regularly}. All of your files are regularly backed-up to the servers in the Department of
  Computer Science and, if you commit your files regularly, stored on GitHub. However, you may want to use a flash
  drive, Google Drive, or your favorite backup method to keep an extra copy of your files on reserve. In the event of
  any type of system failure, you are responsible for ensuring that you have access to a recent backup copy of all your
  files.

\item {\bf Explore teamwork and technologies}. While certain aspects of the laboratory assignments will be challenging
  for you, each part is designed to give you the opportunity to learn both fundamental concepts in the field of computer
  science and explore advanced technologies that are commonly employed at a wide variety of companies. To explore and
  develop new ideas, you should regularly communicate with your team and/or the teaching assistants and tutors.

\item {\bf Hone your technical writing skills}. Computer science assignments require to you write technical
  documentation and descriptions of your experiences when completing each task. Take extra care to ensure that your
  writing is interesting and both grammatically and technically correct, remembering that computer scientists must
  effectively communicate and collaborate with their team members and the tutors, teaching assistants, and course
  instructor.

\item {\bf Review the Honor Code on the syllabus}. While you may discuss your assignments with others, copying source
  code or writing is a violation of Allegheny College's Honor Code.

\end{itemize}

\section*{Reading Assignment}

If you have not done so already, please read all of the relevant ``GitHub
Guides'', available at \url{https://guides.github.com/}, that explain how to use
many of the features that GitHub provides. In particular, please make sure that
you have read guides such as ``Mastering Markdown'' and ``Documenting Your
Projects on GitHub''; each of them will help you to understand how to use both
GitHub and GitHub Classroom. To do well on this laboratory assignment, you
should also review Sections 1.5.2 and 1.9 in the textbook, paying particularly
close attention to the material on iteration constructs and testing. Critically,
you should study all of the written content, source code, and technical diagrams
in Sections 7.1 and 7.2 about the \program{ArrayList} data structure. Please see
the instructor or a teaching assistant if you have questions about these reading
assignments.

\section*{Accessing the Laboratory Assignment on GitHub}

To access the laboratory assignment, you should go into the
\channel{\#announcements} channel in our Slack team and find the announcement
that provides a link for it. Copy this link and paste it into a web browser.
Now, you should accept the assignment and see that GitHub Classroom created a
new GitHub repository for you to access the assignment's starting materials and
to store the completed version of your assignment. Specifically, to access your
new GitHub repository for this assignment, please click the green ``Accept''
button and then click the link that is prefaced with the label ``Your assignment
has been created here''. If you accepted the assignment and correctly followed
these steps, you should have created a GitHub repository with a name like
``Allegheny-Computer-Science-112-Spring-2018/computer-science-112-spring-2018-lab-9-gkapfham''.
Unless you provide the course instructor with documentation of the extenuating
circumstances that you are facing, not accepting the assignment means that you
automatically receive a failing grade for it.

Before you move to the next step of this assignment, please make sure that you
read all of the content on the web site for your new GitHub repository, paying
close attention to the technical details about the commands that you will type
and the output that your program must produce. Now you are ready to download the
starting materials to your laboratory computer. Click the ``Clone or download''
button and, after ensuring that you have selected ``Clone with SSH'', please
copy this command to your clipboard. To enter into your course directory you
should now type \command{cd cs112S2018}. By typing \command{git clone} in your
terminal and then pasting in the string that you copied from the GitHub site you
will download all of the code for this assignment. For instance, if the course
instructor ran the \command{git clone} command in the terminal, it would look
like:

\begin{lstlisting}
  git clone git@github.com:Allegheny-Computer-Science-112-S2018/computer-science-112-spring-2018-lab-9-gkapfham.git
\end{lstlisting}

After this command finishes, you can use \command{cd} to change into the new
directory. What files and directories do you see? What do you think is their
purpose? Specifically, each student should ensure that they fully understand
every test case in the \testprogramsource{}.

\section*{Understanding, Implementing, and Testing an \tt{ArrayList}}

There are several \command{TODO} markers inside of the provided Java source
code. Ultimately, it is your responsibility to read each of these and provide
the required Java source code. With that said, the remainder of this section
will provide some pointers to help you to implement the needed methods.
Specifically, this assignment asks you to run experiments that produce output
like that which Figure~\ref{fig:output} provides. In particular, you will
implement, test, and strive to fully understand a complete implementation of the
\program{ArrayList} data structure. Some of the missing source code in the
provided implementation can be found in Code Fragments 7.2 and 7.3 in the
textbook. Please recall that the source code in the textbook does not adhere to
the Checkstyle standards and thus you will have to improve the source code from
these Code Fragments. An important method that you must implement in the
\program{ArrayList} is the \program{toString} that produces a textual
representation of the array-based data structure. If the \program{ArrayList}
contains a total of $n$ elements then the \program{toString} method should
return a \program{String} of the form ``$(e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_n)$''. Once you
are confident that your \program{toString} method returns the correct textual
representation of the \program{ArrayList} you should also implement generic
methods for equivalence testing (i.e., \program{equals}) and data replacement
(i.e., \program{set}).

  \begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \begin{verbatim}

    ArrayList before removing first element:
    (9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0)

    ArrayList after removing first element:
    (8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0)

    ArrayList after removing last element:
    (8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1)

    \end{verbatim}
  \vspace*{-.5in}
  \caption{The Output from Running the \program{main} Method in the
  \program{ArrayList}.}~\label{fig:output}
  \vspace*{-.25in}
\end{figure}


Remember, if you want to \step{build} your program you can type the command
\gradlebuild{} in your terminal, thereby causing the Java compiler to check your
program for errors and get it ready to run. If you notice that some of the test
cases do not pass, please improve your implementation until all of the tests
pass and your program's output looks similar to that which is provided in
Figure~\ref{fig:output}. Once the program runs and the tests pass, please
reflect on this process. You should write your reflections in a file called
\reflection{}. To complete this assignment part, you should write one paragraph
that reports on your experiences. Your \reflection{} file should have answers to
the questions about the \program{ArrayList}'s implementation, testing,
and experimental evaluation; please provide your data table in a Markdown-based
fenced code block.

\section*{Checking the Correctness of Your Program and Writing}

As verified by the Checkstyle tool, the source code for the \mainprogram{} and
the other Java files must adhere to all of the requirements in the Google Java
Style Guide available at
\url{https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html}. The Markdown file that
contains your reflection must adhere to the standards described in the Markdown
Syntax Guide \url{https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/}.
Finally, your \reflection{} file should adhere to the Markdown standards
established by the \step{Markdown linting} tool available at
\url{https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint/}. Instead of requiring you to
manually check that your deliverables adhere to these industry-accepted
standards, GatorGrader makes it easy for you to automatically check if your
submission meets the standards for correctness. For instance, GatorGrader will
run the provided JUnit tests, check to ensure that a source code files contains
the right number of \program{println} statements, and see that you commit to
GitHub a sufficient number of times when completing this assignment. The focus
for this assignment is checking that all of the provided tests correctly pass.

To get started with the use of GatorGrader, type the command \gatorgraderstart{}
in your terminal window. Once this step completes you can type
\gatorgradercheck{}. If your work does not meet all of the assignment's
requirements, then you will see the following output in your terminal:
\command{Overall, are there any mistakes in the assignment? Yes}. If you do have
mistakes in your assignment, then you will need to review GatorGrader's output,
find the mistake, and try to fix it. Once your program is building correctly,
fulfilling at least some of the assignment's requirements, you should transfer
your files to GitHub using the \gitcommit{} and \gitpush{} commands. If you
notice that transferring your code or writing to GitHub did not work, then
please try to determine why, asking a teaching assistant or the instructor for
assistance.

After the course instructor enables \step{continuous integration} with a system
called Travis CI, when you use the \gitpush{} command to transfer your source
code to your GitHub repository, Travis CI will initialize a \step{build} of your
assignment, checking to see if it meets all of the requirements. If both your
source code and writing meet all of the established requirements, then you will
see a green \checkmark{} in the listing of commits in GitHub after awhile. If
your submission does not meet the requirements, a red \naughtmark{} will appear
instead. The instructor will reduce a student's grade for this assignment if the
red \naughtmark{} appears on the last commit in GitHub immediately before the
assignment's due date. Yet, if the green \checkmark{} appears on the last commit
in your GitHub repository, then you satisfied all of the main checks, thereby
allowing the course instructor to evaluate other aspects of your source code and
writing, as further described in the \step{Evaluation} section of this
assignment sheet. Unless you provide the instructor with documentation of the
extenuating circumstances that you are facing, no late work will be considered
towards your grade for this laboratory assignment.

\section*{Summary of the Required Deliverables}

\noindent Students do not need to submit printed source code or technical
writing for any assignment in this course. Instead, this assignment invites you
to submit, using GitHub, the following deliverables.

\vspace*{-.05in}

\begin{enumerate}

  \setlength{\itemsep}{0in}

\item Stored in a Markdown file called \reflection{}, a one-paragraph response,
  for each of the stated questions. Make sure to include the requested results
  in a fenced code block.

\item A properly documented and correct version of all the Java source files
  (e.g., the file for \program{ArrayList}) that meets the set requirements and
  produces the desired experimental output.

\end{enumerate}

\vspace*{-.1in}

\section*{Evaluation of Your Laboratory Assignment}

Using a report that the instructor shares with you through the commit log in
GitHub, you will privately received a grade on this assignment and feedback on
your submitted deliverables. Your grade for the assignment will be a function of
the whether or not it was submitted in a timely fashion and if your program
received a green \checkmark{} indicating that it met all of the requirements.
Other factors will also influence your final grade on the assignment. In
addition to studying the efficiency and effectiveness of your Java source code,
the instructor will also evaluate the accuracy of both your technical writing
and the comments in your source code. If your submission receives a red
\naughtmark{}, the instructor will reduce your grade for the assignment while
still considering the regularity with which you committed to your GitHub
repository and the overall quality of your partially completed work. Please see
the instructor if you have questions about the evaluation of this laboratory
assignment.

% \section*{Adhering to the Honor Code}

% In adherence to the Honor Code, students should complete this assignment on an individual basis. While it is appropriate
% for students in this class to have high-level conversations about the assignment, it is necessary to distinguish
% carefully between the student who discusses the principles underlying a problem with others and the student who produces
% assignments that are identical to, or merely variations on, someone else's work. Deliverables (e.g., Java source code or
% Markdown-based technical writing) that are nearly identical to the work of others will be taken as evidence of violating
% the \mbox{Honor Code}. Please see the course instructor if you have questions about this policy.
